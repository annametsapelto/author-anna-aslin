        <h2>To See the Dragons Fly</h2>
        <p>To See the Dragons Fly is a romantic high fantasy story centering around three characters, Ternon, Rejena and Niveer,
          who struggle to survive in a wartorn world and find love together. The book deals with war and how there are no innocent
          sides, how not to turn into a monster even though one is forced to do horrible things, but also the healing force 
          of love and that it can defy conventions. The book is a standalone, but it is possible that there will be an independent sequel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The war has lasted for eight years. The former spy master Ternon, who had been demoted for his past mistakes,
          and Rejena, a mage broken by her losses, are sent into the enemy territory to retrieve the Egg of Simeor, which
          can awaken the last dragons of the world to defend their country and end the war. They leave behind their mutual lover,
          Niveer, who is also a mage, to face the ugly truths of warfare.
