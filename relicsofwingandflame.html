        <h2>Relics of Wing And Flame series</h2>

        <p>
          Relics of Wing And Flame series is set in a pseudo-Medieval fantasy world three hundred years after the Aylathim,
          revered now as divine by the humans, won the war against the Erethim, told to be demons.
        </p>
        <p>
            After her city state home was conquered, Alna Deymar became a camp follower, 
            serving the Red Shields where her brother Felin is now third in command. After a battle she is looting the corpses
            when she finds a peculiar jewellery box on a dead messenger. And even more peculiar is that when she opens it, a man comes
            out of it. And not just any man, an Erethim mage-smith called Michoderimus who is bound to the box unable to go far from it,
            unable to touch it and unable to hurt the ne holding it. After being a prisoner inside the box, he needs her help
            to find out what has happened to his clan. And she needs his help to survive the war brewing on the horizon.
        </p>
        <p>The first book in the series <i>Ashes And Chains</i> follow Alna and Mick and a number of their mercenary
        companions as they flee the fights toward Mick's old home far in the south. Mick seeks his old enchanted forge to 
    get free of his prison box while the others look for treasure. But what do they find?</p>
