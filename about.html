        <p>Anna Aslin grew up on a farm in northern Finland in the middle of forests and fields.
          She fell in love with stories as a small girl, especially those that had magic. She could have listened to stories
          for hours and she became quite a voracious reader. At the age of nine she discovered that there is a whole
          section of books dealing with magic, knights, castles, witches and wizards and everything else she loved. Fantasy.
          That became her literary home.
        </p>
        <p>She started to write her first fantasy story when she was thirteen after getting a very strong idea while skiing in the forest.
          In the next year she filled nine notebooks with the story which had at first been expanded into a trilogy
          and eventually turned out to be a lot longer than even that. Though despite rewrites, The Firetree has not been finished. 
          Though perhaps one day...

        <p>Currently Anna is working on several romantic fantasy stories ranging from the gothic Demons of Aldermere series
          to more Medieval epic Relics of Wing And Flame series as well as a number of standalones.
